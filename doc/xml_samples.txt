here are examples of the basic structure of some of the xml formats
that optimus uses to store data. none of them are really implemented,
and they are all subject to change. they are just provided to give you
an idea of how things will fit together.


example of xml for defining a Simulation, which is basically a named
grouping of federates: 

-----------
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<simulation name="traffic and pollution">
  <description>
    a simulation of a system involving traffic
    that produces pollution which diffuses in the
    atmosphere. it includes both cars and stationary
    pollution producers. the movement of the cars is 
    controlled by traffic lights on a regular schedule.
  </description>

  <federates>
    <!-- the order that the federates are listed in is important -->
    <federate system="roads"     file="roads.xml"/>
    <federate system="lights"    file="lights.xml"/>
    <federate system="smoggers"  file="smoggers.xml"/>
    <federate system="traffic"   file="traffic.xml"/>
    <federate system="wind"      file="wind.xml"/>
    <federate system="pollution" file="pollution.xml"/>
  </federates>

</simulation>

example of xml for defining a Scenario

-----------
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<scenario name="exercise 1" simulation="traffic and pollution">
   <description>
      traffic and pollution model with no stationary smoggers,
      30 cars and a system of roads and traffic lights for a 
      small fictional town. students are encouraged to adjust
      the timing ratio for the traffic lights to see how it 
      affects air pollution levels.
   </description>

   <!-- masks override the attributes of federates in the 
        scenario. any parameters specified in the mask will
        override the corresponding parameter for the corresponding
        attribute from the federate that implements that mask's system
    -->
   <masks>
         <mask system="roads" varname="road_def_file"
             value="exercise1_roads.dat" editable="no" />
         <mask system="lights" varname="light_placement_data_file"
             value="exercise2_lights.dat" editable="no" />
         <mask system="lights" varname="timing_ratio"
             value="3" min="0" max="100" editable="yes" />
         <mask system="smoggers" varname="num_smoggers" value="0"
             editable="no" />
         <mask system="traffic" varname="num_cars" value="30"
             editable="no"/>
	 <mask system="traffic" varname="starting_positions_file"
             value="exercise1_cars.dat" editable="no" />
   </masks>

</scenario>
